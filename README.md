# Dino Game

A recreation of the [offline dinosaur game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinosaur_Game) from Google Chrome, made using C++. Despite being a console application, it has a fake pixel display made by setting color backgrounds for pairs of ASCII characters displayed on screen.

As a personal touch I've added an option to change the color palette. All available palettes:
